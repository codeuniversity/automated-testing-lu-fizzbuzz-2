# Automated Testing LU FizzBuzz 2

Are you here because you are taking part in the LU?

Please open: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/codeuniversity/automated-testing-lu-fizzbuzz-2/blob/main/README.py

## Follow these Instructions
1. copy your tests into the different implementation files:
    - `implementation1.py`
    - `implementation2.py`
    - `implementation3.py`
    - `implementation4.py`
    - `implementation5.py`
    - `implementation6.py`
2. run your tests for each file, by doing one of the following:
    - open the implementation file you want to run and click on the little play button at the top-right of the editor
    - OR open a terminal and type `python implementationX.py`, where X is a number from 1 through 6
3. What are the results? Did you find any bugs? If you did, how many?
